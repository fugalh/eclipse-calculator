# Defects
- rapid taps on phone zooms instead of modifying die
- is hit priority logic in line with NPC algo? "If possible, dice are assigned so that your Ships are destroyed from largest to smallest. If none of your Ships can be destroyed in the Attack, dice are assigned to inflict as much damage to your Ships as possible, from largest to smallest."

# Wishlist
- Faction presets
- second dawn ancient/guardian/gcd blueprints
- clearing planets (don't forget neutron bombs and neutron absorber)
- game edition filter
- user pref for destruction order
- "survival" would be more interesting if discretized
