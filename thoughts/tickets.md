# Fixes

- audit: is hit priority logic in line with NPC algo? "If possible, dice are assigned so that your Ships are destroyed from largest to smallest. If none of your Ships can be destroyed in the Attack, dice are assigned to inflict as much damage to your Ships as possible, from largest to smallest."
- TESTS

# Wishlist

- Faction presets
- second dawn ancient/guardian/gcd blueprints
- clearing planets (don't forget neutron bombs and neutron absorber)
- game edition filter
- "survival" would be more interesting if discretized. need to think about what we can say
- continuous async update. Just show one-line stats along the bottom that async calculate/update when _anything_ is changed. it could be expanded for more detail like probability of ships being lost.
- user pref for destruction order
