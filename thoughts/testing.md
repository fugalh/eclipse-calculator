Test plan, at least until we have unit tests
1. load fresh, hit calculate - abt 80/20
2. cruiser vs cruiser (or other equivalent), slightly favoring the defender.
3. From equal match, give some advantage to the attacker
   1. number of ships
   2. initiative
   3. hulls
   4. computers
   5. shields
   6. cannons each color
   7. missiles each color
