---

## Game Concepts

### Actions and Activations

During each game Round, players take turns selecting and resolving individual Actions until all players Pass. Actions are comprised of a number of Activations that correspond to your Species and the Techs you have Researched. Each Activation allows you to perform an activity associated with the chosen Action.

### Resources

Sectors produce up to three kinds of Resources:

| Resource | Symbol | Used For |
|----------|--------|----------|
| **Materials** | Orange | Building new Ships and Structures |
| **Science** | Pink | Researching new Technologies |
| **Money** | Brown | Controlling Sectors and taking Actions |

The amount of each Resource you have is marked with a Storage Marker on your Storage Track. When you Produce or gain Resources, move the appropriate Storage Marker forward. When you Pay Resources, move it backward.

**Storage Overflow:** If you ever have more than 40 of one kind of Resource, turn the Storage Marker so that the four-pointed end faces the center of the Control Board, indicating you have 40 plus the Storage Track value.

### Trade

At any time, as many times as you choose and are able, you may Pay the number of one Resource indicated by the Trade Value on your Species Board to gain one Resource of any other kind.

### Population Cubes

Population Cubes placed on Sectors Produce Resources. The highest value empty square on each Population Track shows how many Resources of each kind you will Produce during the Upkeep Phase.

### Colony Ships

Colony Ships are used to place Population Cubes on Population Squares in Sectors you Control. **Colony Ships are the only way to move Population Cubes to Sectors.**

### Influence Discs

Influence Discs mark the Sectors your civilization Controls. Each Action you take requires you to move an Influence Disc from your Influence Track to the corresponding Action Space.

- The leftmost Influence Disc is always used when moving from your Influence Track
- When returned to the Influence Track, discs are placed on the rightmost available space
- The rightmost empty space shows how much Money you must Pay at the end of the Round

### Control

The player with an Influence Disc in a Sector Controls it. Controlling Sectors allows you to:
- Colonize planets
- Produce Resources
- Build Ships and Structures
- Explore, Move, or Influence from that Sector

The player that Controls a Sector Controls its Structures and is always considered the Defender in battles there.

### Technologies

Researching Techs gives your civilization advantages. Techs are divided into categories:
- **Military** (Crosshair symbol)
- **Grid** (Grid symbol)
- **Nano** (Gear symbol)
- **Rare** (Circle symbol)

Each Tech you Research gives you a discount on further Techs Researched in the same category.

### Ships

Ships are used for Exploring and fighting opponents. There are four kinds:

| Ship Type | Count | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **Interceptors** | 8 per player | Smallest, fastest |
| **Cruisers** | 4 per player | Medium |
| **Dreadnoughts** | 2 per player | Largest |
| **Starbases** | 4 per player | Immobile defense |

### Blueprints

All Ships have Blueprints depicting their abilities (weapons, Initiative, Shields, etc.). Player Ship Blueprints are on their Species Board and can be customized using the Upgrade Action.

Some Ship Blueprints have extra Ship Parts outside the Ship Part grid. These work just like other Ship Parts except they cannot be replaced.

### Ship Parts

| Part Type | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| **Weapons** | For each Die Symbol, roll one die of the corresponding color |
| **Computers** | Added to die rolls to Hit |
| **Shields** | Subtracted from opponent die rolls to Hit |
| **Hull** | Determines how much damage Ship can absorb |
| **Drives** | Determines Ship's Movement Value |
| **Energy Sources** | Determines total Energy Production |

### Structures

| Structure | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| **Orbitals** | Provide an additional Population Square |
| **Monoliths** | Grant 3 VP at end of game |

Structures are permanent and remain in the Sector until the end of the game.

### Zones and Rings

The game board is comprised of Zones where Sectors can be placed. Zones and Sectors are grouped into Rings:
- **Ring I (Inner)** - Closest to Galactic Center
- **Ring II (Middle)** - Middle distance
- **Ring III (Outer)** - Furthest from center

### Wormholes

Ships may only Move using the Wormhole network. Wormholes may normally only be used to Explore, Move to, and Influence adjacent Sectors if the edges connecting the Sector tiles each contain a Wormhole, creating a **Wormhole Connection**.

### Discovery Tiles

Some Sectors contain a Discovery Tile awarded when:
- The Sector is first Explored (if unoccupied)
- The Sector's defender is destroyed (if occupied)

Each Discovery Tile is double-sided:
- **Front:** Various rewards (Resources, Technologies, Ship Parts, etc.)
- **Back:** 2 VP value

When awarded a Discovery Tile, you must reveal it and decide which side to use before ending your Activation.

### Ambassador Tiles (4+ Players)

In games with four or more players, you can use Ambassadors to form Diplomatic Relations with other players. Diplomatic Relations increase your Production and are worth VP at the end of the game.

### Reputation Tiles

You receive Reputation Tiles for participating in combat. They are worth 1-4 VP at the end of the game.

### Limited vs Unlimited Components

**Limited:** Ships, Population Cubes, Influence Discs, Tech Tiles, Discovery Tiles, Reputation Tiles, Sectors, Ambassador Tiles - if they run out, they run out.

**Unlimited:** All other game components. If they run out, use provided extra tiles or substitutes.

### Forming Diplomatic Relations

If both players agree:
1. Each player gives the other one Ambassador Tile containing a Population Cube from any Population Track
2. Ambassador Tiles are placed on empty Ambassador Tile spaces on each player's Reputation Track

### Breaking Diplomatic Relations

Diplomatic Relations are broken by an **Act of Aggression**: having any number of your Ships in a Sector where the other player has a Ship or Control at the end of your Action.

**Note:** Moving through an opponent's Sectors is NOT an Act of Aggression if your Ships remain Unpinned!

When broken:
- Each player returns the other's Ambassador Tile and Population Cube
- The player initiating the Act of Aggression receives the **Traitor Tile**

### Traitor Tile

The player holding the Traitor Tile:
- Cannot form Diplomatic Relations
- Receives -2 VP penalty at end of game

---

## Combat Phase

The Combat Phase consists of six steps:

### 1. Determine Battles
Identify all Sectors containing opposing Ships.

### 2. Resolve Battles
Resolve battles by Sector Number in **descending numerical order**.

### 3. Attack Population
Ships attack opponent Population Cubes in their Sector.

### 4. Influence Sectors
Players may take Control of Uncontrolled Sectors where they have Ships.

### 5. Discovery Tiles
Undefended Discovery Tiles are claimed.

### 6. Repair Damage
All Ship damage is reset by returning Damage Cubes to supply.

---

## Resolve Battles

### Battle Order

- Battles are resolved in **descending Sector Number order**
- Battles with multiple opponents are resolved between two players at a time in **reverse order of entry** into the Sector
- Non-player Ships (Ancients, Guardians, GCDS) battle the last surviving player

### Attacker vs Defender

- The player who first entered the Sector is the **Defender**
- The player who entered last is the **Attacker**
- **A player who Controls the Sector is always the Defender**, regardless of entry order
- Ancients, Guardians, and GCDS are always considered Defenders

### Initiative

Initiative determines the order of Attack in an Engagement Round:
- Total the Initiative Symbols on the Blueprint of each Ship type
- Initiative ties between opponents are resolved in favor of the Defender
- You choose the order for your own Ships that are tied

### Steps of Battle (Per Sector)

1. Determine order of player battle resolution
2. Determine Attacker and Defender
3. Determine Initiative
4. **Fire Missiles** (first round only)
5. Repeated Engagement Rounds

For battles with more than two opponents, repeat steps 1-5 until a single opponent's Ships remain.

### Firing Missiles

All Ship types with Missiles fire their Missiles in Initiative order. Roll dice of the corresponding color equal to the number of Die Symbols on Missile Ship Parts.

**Missiles fire only once per battle (before the first Engagement Round).**

### Engagement Rounds

Each Engagement Round, Ship types are Activated in Initiative order. When Activated, the owning player decides whether to **Attack** or **Retreat**.

Engagement Rounds repeat until all of one player's Ships have Retreated or are destroyed.

### Attacking

In Initiative order, each Ship type may Attack by rolling one die of the corresponding color for every Die Symbol on their Ship Blueprint.

**All dice of all colors for each Ship type are rolled simultaneously.**

After rolling, each die is assigned to a single opponent Ship to determine if it's a Hit.

### Hitting

| Die Result | Outcome |
|------------|---------|
| One or more bursts (★) | **Always a Hit** |
| Blank face | **Always a Miss** |
| Number | Calculate Hit Value |

**Hit Value Calculation:**
```
Hit Value = Die Roll + Your Computers - Target's Shields
```

If Hit Value ≥ 6, it's a Hit.

### Damage

- Hits inflict damage equal to the number of bursts (★) on their weapon's Die Symbol
- Ships receiving damage greater than their Hull Value are destroyed
- Damage exceeding a Ship's Hull Value cannot be assigned to another Ship
- Mark damage on surviving Ships with Damage Cubes

### Retreat

To attempt Retreat during a Ship Activation:
1. Move all your Ships of that type to the edge of a neighboring Sector with a Wormhole Connection
2. You may only Retreat to a Sector you Control where no opponent Ships are present
3. On next Ship Activation, Retreating Ships may complete Retreat by moving to the neighboring Sector

**Retreating Ships:**
- Cannot Attack or be Attacked during current battle
- Are eligible to be Attacked until moved to neighboring Sector

### Hits and Damage with Non-Player Opponents

When battling Ancients, Guardians, or GCDS:
- Any other player rolls their dice
- Dice are assigned to destroy your Ships from largest to smallest if possible
- Otherwise, inflict maximum damage to largest Ships first

### Stalemate

If neither player can destroy the other's Ships (all Ships unarmed or only have Missiles):
- The Attacker must Retreat
- If Attacker cannot Retreat, their Ships are destroyed

### Reputation Tiles

After all battles in a Sector, each participating player draws Reputation Tiles:

| Source | Tiles Drawn |
|--------|-------------|
| Participating in battle | 1 |
| Each Interceptor destroyed | 1 |
| Each Starbase destroyed | 1 |
| Each Ancient destroyed | 1 |
| Each Cruiser destroyed | 2 |
| Each Guardian destroyed | 2 |
| Each Dreadnought destroyed | 3 |
| Destroying GCDS | 3 |

**Maximum 5 tiles per battle.**

Drawing is done in order of player entry:
1. Draw Reputation Tiles
2. Select up to one to place facedown on Reputation Track
3. Return others to bag

**Retreat Penalty:** If all your remaining Ships attempt to Retreat, you do NOT draw a tile for participating (but still draw for destroyed opponent Ships).

---

## Completing the Combat Phase

### Attack Population

At end of Combat Phase, remaining Ships attack opponent Population Cubes in their Sector:
- Each Ship may attack once with non-Missile weapons
- Use normal rules to Hit (Population Cubes have 0 Shield Value)
- Each damage destroys one Population Cube of attacker's choosing

**Neutron Bombs Tech:** All Population Cubes in the Sector may be destroyed automatically.

Destroyed Population Cubes are returned to the defeated player's Graveyards on their Control Board.

### Influence Sectors

At end of Combat Phase, if you have at least one Ship in a Sector that has no Population Cubes (including Orbitals):
1. Remove the Controlling player's Influence Disc to their Influence Track
2. You may move Influence Discs from your Influence Track to any Sector where you have a Ship and no Influence Disc is present

### Discovery Tiles

At end of Combat Phase, if you have at least one Ship in a Sector with a Discovery Tile, take the tile.

### Repair Damage

Remove all Damage Cubes from Ships.

---

## Upkeep Phase

### Colony Ships

All players may activate any remaining Colony Ships to move Population Cubes to Sectors.

**Important:** Unlike the Action Phase, Colony Ships **cannot** be used during Upkeep Phase to move Population Cubes to Sectors containing opponent Ships.

### Civilization Upkeep

Compare your **Money Income** (highest exposed number on Money Population Track) with your **Civilization Upkeep Cost** (highest exposed number on Influence Track).

Adjust your Money Storage Marker by the net difference:
- Positive difference = Gain Money
- Negative difference = Pay Money

### Bankruptcy

At no time may your Money Storage Marker move below zero. If you can't pay:

1. **Trade** Materials and/or Science for Money
2. **Abandon** Control of Sectors until Upkeep Cost is affordable

When Abandoning a Sector:
- Influence Disc returns to Influence Track
- All Population Cubes return to respective Population Tracks

**Warning:** Abandoning may reduce Income as Population Cubes return to Money Track.

### Player Elimination

Players are eliminated if:
- Unable to Pay Civilization Upkeep Cost after Trading and Abandoning
- Having neither Ships nor Controlled Sectors at end of Combat Phase

Eliminated players count their score and return components to the game box.

### Materials and Science Production

After Upkeep Cost, collect Materials and Science Production equal to the highest exposed number on respective Population Tracks.

## Cleanup Phase

### New Tech Tiles

| Players | Tiles to Draw |
|---------|---------------|
| 2 | 5 |
| 3 | 6 |
| 4 | 7 |
| 5 | 8 |
| 6 | 9 |

Draw Tech Tiles from the Tech Tile Bag until the indicated number of regular Tech Tiles has been drawn. Rare Tech Tiles do not count toward this number.

### End of Round

1. Move all Influence Discs from Action Track back to Influence Track
2. Move Population Cubes from Graveyards to respective Population Tracks
3. Flip all Colony Ships faceup
4. Flip Summary Tiles to Action Phase Overview side
5. Move Round Marker one step forward

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Resources

**Q: Where can I get more Resources?**
A: Place Influence Discs on Sectors, use Colony Ships to move Population Cubes to Population Squares, Research Advanced Techs for Advanced Population Squares, Build Orbitals, collect Discovery Tiles.

**Q: What do I need Money for?**
A: Pay your Civilization Upkeep Cost. The more Actions you take and Sectors you Control, the more you pay each Round. You can also Trade Money for other Resources.

### Influence Discs

**Q: I don't have enough Influence Discs. What now?**
A: Use Influence Action to return up to two discs from Sectors. Research Advanced Robotics and Quantum Grid for more discs. You can deliberately use more than you can pay for, forcing you to return some during Upkeep.

### Technologies

**Q: The best Techs are expensive. How can I afford them?**
A: Buy Techs in increasing price order within a category to maximize discounts.

**Q: If I have Gluon Computer Tech, can I take Positron Computer Ship Parts?**
A: No. Each Ship Part (except defaults) requires its own Tech.

### Combat

**Q: My Ships keep getting destroyed. How can I win more battles?**
A: Upgrade Drives for Initiative (shoot first), use Missiles, upgrade Shields (can't be Hit), upgrade Hull (survive more Hits), collect Discovery Tiles for unique Ship Parts.

A: Yes, when specialized. Upgrade with better Energy Source for firepower. Also great for Pinning larger Ships.
